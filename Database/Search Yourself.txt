•If the data is not accurate, where can it be updated and changed?  Or should it be?
There isn't any option on the Intelius website for me to change data.  I suspect alot of it is pulled from the social networks.  So, I could update those sites and see if any of the aggregated dated is updated.
Intelius just gives you basic 'teaser' information.  And then they try to sell you more detailed reports: 
+People Search Report $0.95
*People Search Plus Report $6.95
#Background Report $39.95

[None of which I would pay for - you could probably find most of this through publicly accessible websites]

•What is your conclusion about finding information about yourself or others on the Internet?
It's pretty easy to find basic information.  Stuff you might easily learn in a conversation.  More complex details might be harder to come by.  Some of it depends on how much you share about yourself on public sites and on social networks.

•What is the usefulness of these types of sites? Do you consider these an invasion of your privacy?
Minimum usefullness.  I do tend to do an internet search when interviewing new candidates for open positions.  Just to see if anything obvious pops up.  I look at their linked in profiles.  Search for blogs they author.  Etc.
I always say anything you put out there on the internet has the potential to spread farther than you intended it to.  So be very careful about your digital life.
It's not an invasion of privacy.  There is sort of an implied consent or acknowledgement of risk when you personally post things or live your life online.
Now things like my social security number, bank accounts, credit card numbers, personal health information - they all carry a higher level of privacy and security requirements.  But as we've seen numerous times in the news - even those things are bound to leak out.
